config WILC3000_SDIO
	bool "SDIO support"
	---help---
	  The Atmel WILC3000 SDIO is a full speed interface. It meets SDIO card
	  specification version 2.0. The interface supports the 1-bit/4-bit SD
	  transfer mode at the clock range of 0-50 MHz. The host can use this
	  interface to read and write from any register within the chip as well
	  as configure the WILC3000 for data DMA. To use this interface,
	  pin 9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) must be grounded. Select this if your platform
	  is using the SDIO interface.

config WILC3000_SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	---help---
	  The Atmel WILC3000 has a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) that
	  operates as a SPI slaves. The SPI interface can be used for control
	  and for serial I/O of 802.11 data. The SPI is a full-duplex slave
	  synchronous serial interface that is available immediately following
	  reset when pin 9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) is tied to VDDIO. Select this if
	  your platform is using the SPI interface.

	---help---
	  Use out of band interrupt for wake on wireless instead of SDIO time
	  devision interrupt. Select this config option when your platform
	  doesn't allow the SDIO card to interrupt host. The external interrupt
	  should be tied to WILC3000 IRQ pin so that the host gets the interrupts
	  from the WILC3000 chip.

	  Say Y here if you want the WILC3000 driver to produce more debug
	  messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a trouble
	  with WILC3000 and want to see what happens in more detail.
