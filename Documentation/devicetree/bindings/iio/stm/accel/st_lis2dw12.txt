* lis2dw12 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2dw12"
              "st,iis2dlpc"
              "st,ais2ih"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                   "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:      interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                   flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                   Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                   interrupt client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lis2dw12-accel@0 {
	compatible = "st,lis2dw12";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
};
